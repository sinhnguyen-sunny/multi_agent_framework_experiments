            "\n",

            "```shell\n",

            "\n",
            "3. Create the game loop: Create a while loop that will run the game until the player closes the window. Inside the loop, you will handle user input, update the game state, and draw objects on the screen.\n",
            "```python\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "2. Ball Movement: Implement the logic for the ball's movement, such as setting its initial position and velocity. Update the ball's position in each game loop iteration and handle bouncing off the paddles and walls.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Scoring: Keep track of each player's score and display it on the screen. Increment the score when a player scores a point by missing the ball.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Game Over: Implement the game over condition and display the winner's score. Provide an option to restart the game.\n",
