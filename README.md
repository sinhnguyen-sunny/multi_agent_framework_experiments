# multi_agent_framework_experiments

## Introduction

This repository contains an experiment comparing three different AI frameworks—Microsoft AutoGen, MetaGPT, and Camel—in the context of building a classic and basic Pong game with two players in Python. The aim of this experiment is to evaluate these frameworks based on ease of customization, time taken to terminate, and overall performance.

## Experimental Setup

### Tools and Environment

The experiment was conducted using a basic Google Colab notebook for computing. The following GPT models were used:
- **Microsoft AutoGen**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **MetaGPT**: `gpt-4`
- **Camel**: `gpt-4`

### Problem Statement

The problem to solve in this experiment was to "Build a classic and basic Pong game with 2 players in Python."

### Main Prompt

The main prompt used for all three frameworks was: "Build a classic and basic Pong game with 2 players in Python."

## Results

### Framework Evaluation

The following table summarizes the results of the experiment:

| Framework          | Quality of Output (Rate from 1 —> 5) | Time to Terminate (mintues) | Experiment Log Link |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Microsoft AutoGen  | 3                                     | 1                  | [MSAutogenPongGame.ipynb](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/MSAutogenPongGame.ipynb) |
| MetaGPT            | 4                                     | 2                  | [MetaGPTPongGame.ipynb](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/MetaGPTPongGame.ipynb) |
| Camel              | 1 (Failed)                            | 9                  | [CAMELAIPongGame.ipynb](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/CAMELAIPongGame.ipynb) |

### Thoughts

- **Microsoft AutoGen**: easy to use, customize. [Link to Experiment](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/MSAutogenPongGame.ipynb)

- **MetaGPT**: Generate quality output for Software Development Task. [Link to Experiment](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/MetaGPTPongGame.ipynb)

**Camel**: Generate quality output for Software Development Task. [here](https://github.com/sinhnguyen-sunny/multi_agent_framework_experiments/blob/main/CAMELAIPongGame.ipynb).
